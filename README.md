## Titanic Survivor Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic passenger data to identify factors that contributed to survival. The analysis is done in Python 3.8 using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not. The dataset can be found in the data folder.

### Getting Started

1 Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

2 Open the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook Titanic_Survivor_Analysis.ipynb

The Jupyter notebook contains the main code for the analysis, including data exploration, feature engineering, data cleaning, and modeling. The notebook also includes visualizations to help understand the data and findings.
